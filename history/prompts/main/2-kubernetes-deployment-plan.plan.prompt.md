## Prompt

Create a Prompt History Record for the implementation plan creation. The stage is 'plan', title should be 'kubernetes-deployment-plan', and it should be placed in history/prompts/main/. Use the template from .specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md if available.

## Response snapshot

Created a Prompt History Record for the kubernetes deployment plan with ID 2, titled 'kubernetes-deployment-plan', in the 'plan' stage, placed in the history/prompts/main/ directory. Used the PHR template from .specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md to create the properly formatted record with all required metadata fields filled in appropriately.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created PHR documenting the kubernetes deployment plan creation process
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for PHR creation
- 📁 Files: Created 1 file: history/prompts/main/2-kubernetes-deployment-plan.plan.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Kubernetes deployment plan implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: PHR successfully created following the template structure with proper metadata

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard PHR creation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue with kubernetes deployment plan implementation
